codeville (0.1.11-0) experimental; urgency=low

  In this version of Codeville, the biggest news for Debian is
  probably the license change, which is now a BSD style license
  instead of the Open Source License v2.0.

  Usability enhancements were introduced upstream, as well as a new
  merge algorithm and performance enhancements.

  !! You must run cdvupgrade on any clients and servers for this    !!
  !! release. Note that it is much faster to do fresh checkouts     !!
  !! than to upgrade clients.                                       !!
